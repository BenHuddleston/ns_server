This is a script to purge ns_config tombstones from pre-7.0 cluster.

To compile, simply call `make' (GNU make is required). This produces a script
called purge_tombstones.sh. The script can be used as follows:

  ./purge_tombstones.sh 127.0.0.1:8091 Administrator

This will prompt for a password and attempt to purge tombstones on all nodes.

The script does roughly the following:

 1. Dynamically compiles and loads a module called purge_tombstones on all
    nodes.
 2. Starts a process called purge_tombstones_server on all nodes.
 3. Suspends ns_config_rep and ns_config_rep_merger on all nodes.
 4. Since there may be replicated changes on the wire, in order to minimize a
    probability of them arriving after step (6), the script will sleep for some
    time.
 5. All nodes are asked to purge their local tombstones.
 6. ns_config_rep and ns_config_rep_merger processes are restarted (to make
    sure they don't reapply purged tombstones that may have been replicated
    before step (3) completed on all nodes).
 7. In case there are errors at any of the steps, the purge_tombstones_server
    processes are killed and ns_config replication is resumed.
