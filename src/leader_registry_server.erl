%% This module implements a global name registry. It's not a general purpose
%% name registry in that it uses certain assumptions about how we register
%% global processes. But that makes the implementation much simpler.
%%
%% The assumptions being made:
%%
%%  - processes are only registered on a master node
%%  - processes live long
%%  - there's no need to unregister processes
%%  - it's uncommon to look for a name that is not registered
%%
%% Brief summary of how things work.
%%
%%  - Each node runs a leader_registry_server process.
%%
%%  - Processes can only be registered on the master node (per mb_master
%%  determination).
%%
%%  - On non-master nodes the registry processes simply keep a read through
%%  cache of known global processes. That is, on first miss, a request to the
%%  master node is sent. Then the result is cached. The cached process is
%%  monitored and removed from the cache if the process itself or the link to
%%  the master node dies.
%%
%%  - Since processes cannot be unregistered, there's no need to do anything
%%  special about it. Cache invalidation relies on the regular Erlang
%%  monitors.
